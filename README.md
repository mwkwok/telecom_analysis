# Analysis, Prediction, Recommendation For Churn Rate of a telecom

A telecom client dataset is explored to engineer features in notebook 01. Then the feature set is brought to fit 7 models, including 4 variations of decision trees, in notebook 02. The best model is selected by comparing various scores' values and its dependence on the features is plotted in the feature importance chart. Finally, the resulting model is studied to plan for actions to lower the churn rate in notebook 03.
